 * Once we have an agreement that these 2 files (custom.css and custom.js) 
 * should be pushed together with the notebooks themselves on the MOOC platform,
 * it would make sense to remove a few shortcuts so that students can't mess up
 * with their notebook to much
 *
 * in particular the keys that change the cell types, and this sort of things
